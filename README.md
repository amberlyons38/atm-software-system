# atm-software-system
An ATM software system I created with C# in Visual Studio for a class project.

IMPORTANT: The SQL database we were required to use to access, store, and change data within the ATM system for the project can only be connected to if on the school
network, so the current code connecting to the database will not work unless on the school network.

Download and extract the ATM.zip file and open the .sln file in the folder with Visual Studio to run.
